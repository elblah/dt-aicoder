# Auto Retry Solution Summary

## Problem
You were experiencing this error and wanted automatic retry functionality:

```
API Error: 500 Internal Server Error
{"error":"429 Too Many Requests","status":500}

Request cancelled. Returning to user input.
```

## Solution Implemented

I've implemented a two-part solution:

### 1. Core API Handler Enhancement
**File**: `/home/blah/poc/aicoder/v2/aicoder/api_handler.py`

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced the existing retry logic to handle your specific error case
- Added support for retrying 500 errors that contain "429 Too Many Requests" content
- Added support for retrying additional HTTP error codes (500, 503, 504)
- Added intelligent rate limiting detection based on error content keywords
- Implemented longer retry delays (10 seconds) for rate limiting errors
- Added user-friendly error messages that distinguish between rate limiting and server errors

**Key Features**:
- **Smart Error Detection**: Detects 500 errors with 429 content (your specific case)
- **Rate Limiting Detection**: Detects rate limiting keywords in any error response
- **Extended Error Support**: Now retries 500, 502, 503, 504, 429 errors
- **Intelligent Delays**: Uses 10-second delays for rate limiting, 5-second for other errors
- **ESC Cancellation**: Maintains existing ESC key support to cancel retries

### 2. Auto Retry Plugin
**Location**: `/home/blah/poc/aicoder/v2/docs/plugins/examples/unstable/auto_retry/`

**Features**:
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Handles all common API errors
- **Configurable**: Environment variables for retry delay and count
- **Smart Detection**: Detects rate limiting regardless of HTTP status code
- **User-Friendly**: Clear messages and ESC cancellation support
- **Easy Installation**: Simple installation script

## How It Works

### Core Enhancement (Immediate Solution)
The core API handler now automatically:

1. **Detects your specific error**: 500 status with "429 Too Many Requests" content
2. **Classifies the error**: Distinguishes between rate limiting and server errors
3. **Applies appropriate retry**: Uses 10-second delay for rate limiting, 5-second for server errors
4. **Shows clear messages**: "Rate limiting error detected. Retrying in 10s..."
5. **Allows cancellation**: Press ESC to cancel retries at any time

### Plugin Solution (Advanced/Configurable)
The plugin provides additional features:

1. **Installation**: Run `./install_plugin.sh` to install
2. **Configuration**: Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AUTO_RETRY_DELAY=5       # Delay between retries
   export AUTO_RETRY_MAX_RETRIES=3  # Maximum retry attempts
   ```
3. **Enhanced Detection**: More sophisticated error pattern matching
4. **Flexible Retry**: Configurable retry counts and delays

## Usage

### Option 1: Core Enhancement (Already Active)
The core enhancement is already active in your AI Coder installation. No additional setup needed - it will automatically retry the error you mentioned.

### Option 2: Plugin Installation (Advanced Features)
For more advanced retry functionality:

1. Navigate to the plugin directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/blah/poc/aicoder/v2/docs/plugins/examples/unstable/auto_retry
   ```

2. Install the plugin:
   ```bash
   ./install_plugin.sh
   ```

3. Configure (optional):
   ```bash
   export AUTO_RETRY_DELAY=10
   export AUTO_RETRY_MAX_RETRIES=5
   ```

4. Run AI Coder as usual:
   ```bash
   python -m aicoder
   ```

## Error Types Handled

### Core Enhancement Handles:
- 500 errors with "429 Too Many Requests" content âœ… **(Your specific case)**
- 500, 502, 503, 504, 429 HTTP errors
- Any error containing rate limiting keywords

### Plugin Additionally Handles:
- More sophisticated error pattern matching
- Configurable retry limits
- Enhanced logging and user feedback

## Example Output

When you encounter the error, you'll now see:

```
API Error: 500 Internal Server Error
{"error":"429 Too Many Requests","status":500}

ðŸ”„ Rate limiting error detected. Retrying in 10s (attempt 1/3) (Press ESC to cancel)
```

And it will automatically retry the request after the delay.

## Testing

Both solutions have been tested:

1. **Core Enhancement**: âœ… Tested and working
2. **Plugin**: âœ… Installation and basic functionality tested
3. **Import Tests**: âœ… All modules import successfully
4. **Environment Variables**: âœ… Configuration variables work correctly

## Recommendation

For your specific use case, the **core enhancement** is sufficient and already active. It will handle the exact error you mentioned automatically.

If you need more advanced features like configurable retry counts or more sophisticated error detection, install the plugin as well.

The solutions are designed to work together - you can use both the core enhancement and the plugin simultaneously for maximum reliability.
