# Context Summary Plugin with Auto Compaction - Final Summary

## Overview
We have successfully developed a comprehensive context summary plugin with auto-compaction capabilities for AICoder. This plugin helps manage long conversations by automatically summarizing context and compacting memory when approaching model-specific token limits.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Context Management
- **Message Count Monitoring**: Automatically summarizes context every 20 messages after reaching 50 messages
- **Model-aware Auto Compaction**: Automatically compacts memory when token usage exceeds 90% of the model's limit
- **Detailed Reason Messages**: Clear feedback explaining why compaction/summarization is being triggered

### 2. Manual Commands
- **/summarize**: Manually trigger context summarization with detailed feedback
- **/compact**: Manually trigger context compaction with token usage information

### 3. Model-specific Token Limits
Support for popular AI models:
- OpenAI models (gpt-5-nano, gpt-4 series, gpt-3.5-turbo)
- Qwen models (qwen3-coder-plus, qwen3-coder-flash)
- Google models (gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro)
- Cerebras models (qwen-3-coder-480b)

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Clear, informative messages about why operations are triggered
- Detailed feedback including message counts and token usage
- Configurable thresholds for customization

## Implementation Details

### Plugin Structure
The plugin is organized in its own directory with:
- `context_summary.py`: Main plugin implementation
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- `test_plugin.py`: Test script with mocked dependencies
- `install_plugin.sh`: Example installation script
- `requirements.txt`: Dependency listing (none for this plugin)
- `__init__.py`: Package initialization

### Technical Approach
- **Monkey Patching**: Enhances existing MessageHistory functionality without modifying core code
- **Environment-aware**: Automatically detects current model from environment variables
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing AICoder functionality
- **Self-contained**: No external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries

## Testing and Validation
- Created comprehensive test suite with mocked AICoder dependencies
- Verified plugin loading and functionality
- Tested model token limit detection
- Validated manual command functionality

## Usage
1. Copy `context_summary.py` to your AICoder plugins directory
2. The plugin automatically loads and begins monitoring context
3. Use `/summarize` and `/compact` commands as needed
4. Monitor detailed feedback messages for insights into plugin operations

This plugin significantly enhances AICoder's ability to handle long conversations while providing clear feedback about memory management operations.
