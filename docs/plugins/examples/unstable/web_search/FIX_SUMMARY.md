# Web Search Plugin Fix Summary

## Problem
The web_search plugin was not working because:
1. The tool was being registered in the tool registry but the tool executor didn't know how to execute it
2. The error message "Internal tool 'web_search' has no implementation" indicated that the tool executor couldn't find the execution function

## Root Cause
The tool executor looks for internal tool functions in the `INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS` dictionary, but plugin-based tools were not being registered there. The web_search plugin was only registering the tool definition but not the execution function.

## Solution
We implemented a two-part fix:

### 1. Updated the web_search plugin (`web_search.py`)
- Added a proper `execute_web_search_with_stats` wrapper function that matches the internal tool function signature
- Modified the `on_aicoder_init` function to register the execution function with the tool executor
- The registration happens by adding the function to the executor's `INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS` dictionary

### 2. Updated the tool executor (`executor.py`)
- Modified the `execute_tool` method to check for plugin-based internal tools
- Added code to look for functions in the executor's `INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS` dictionary if not found in the standard internal tools

## Key Changes

### In `web_search.py`:
```python
def on_aicoder_init(aicoder_instance):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Register the execution function with the internal tool functions
    if hasattr(aicoder_instance.tool_manager, 'executor'):
        if not hasattr(aicoder_instance.tool_manager.executor, 'INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS'):
            aicoder_instance.tool_manager.executor.INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS = {}
        aicoder_instance.tool_manager.executor.INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS['web_search'] = execute_web_search_with_stats
```

### In `executor.py`:
```python
if tool_type == "internal":
    # First check if it's in the standard internal tool functions
    func = INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS.get(tool_name)
    if not func:
        # Check if it's a plugin-based internal tool
        # Plugin tools are registered directly in the executor's INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS
        if hasattr(self, 'INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS'):
            func = self.INTERNAL_TOOL_FUNCTIONS.get(tool_name)
```

## Verification
The fix has been tested and verified:
- All plugin functions execute correctly
- The tool can be called with proper arguments
- Results are returned in the expected format
- Error handling works properly

## Benefits
- Plugin-based internal tools now work correctly
- No changes needed to the core internal tools system
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Clean integration with existing tool execution system

## Usage
After this fix, the web_search plugin will work correctly when:
1. The plugin is installed in the plugins directory
2. AI Coder is run (plugins are automatically loaded)
3. The AI calls the web_search tool with appropriate arguments
